## Backend Service:

Api for get steam-profile, api-geolocalization, rustmap info:

First, in order to use your custom served api, you need to edit environment.prod.ts and change `http://rustmon-udata.tercerpiso.tech/` for your endpoint and rebuild docker image, or run ng build again with your changes.

Second, you need to start a redis service (it is used for cache user data).

Third, you need to run our docker image of rustmon-service with your api key and environments and expose in your endpoint:

```
docker run -p 80:3000 -e STEAM_API="YOUR-STEAM-API-KEY" -e CACHE_HOST="YOUR-REDIS-HOST" -e CACHE_AUTH="YOUR-REDIS-PASSWORD" -e CACHE_PORT="YOUR-REDIS-PORT" -itd alexander171294/rustmon-service:latest
```
